> These GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models seemingly removed the threshold for diving into Artificial intelligence for those without a technical background.

The author noted at the beginning that AI-Chat reduces the barrier for those without a technical background to explore artificial intelligence. Therefore, in the era of GPT, learning how to ask questions, more specifically, how to formulate clear and specific inquiries, has become a crucial skill. This human ability to craft targeted questions corresponds to a concept in the field of artificial intelligence known as prompt engineering.


## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory holds enduring inspirational value. 
The reason why comparisons are often drawn between AI and human psychology or cognitive science is that humans find it challenging to perceive or understand concepts that lie outside our realm of comprehension. I know this might sound strange, but consider trying to explain the same landscape to both an ant and a giraffe—each would interpret it differently based on their unique sensory capabilities.

The author spent considerable time discussing the differences between AI and human from various angles. From my perspective, the most fundamental distinction between AI and human lies in their distinct needs. Maslow's hierarchy of needs can provide a concise and comprehensive framework to encapsulate human needs. For example, humans require air and water, whereas artificial intelligence needs hardware and electricity.These differing needs lead to a cascade of other differences, such as identity, relative advantages and disadvantages, memory, self-motivation, and usage of tools.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the field has already replicated human senses such as vision and language through technologies like computer vision and natural language processing. Moving forward, I think maybe we can delve deeper into areas like the human subconscious which is a vast unexplored territory that holds immense potential. However, studying the subconscious will be more challenging than studying vision and language, as there is still much about ourselves which remains unknown. I think a possible future direction might involve exploring and studying the inner workings of humanity itself, which could potentially inspire further research in artificial intelligence, leading to new insights and innovations in the field. After all, technology is continually evolving and iterating, but the exploration of humanity itself is infinite.

## My Perspective on the Explainability of Artificial Intelligence Models

Human learning is fundamentally driven by imitation, and understanding the nature of this imitation is central to interpretability. Nowadays,however,there appears to be a plethora of ongoing research on interpretability,some of which may seem superfluous. My perspective is that the pursuit of interpretability, at its core, stems from a desire for certainty—a guarantee that ensures the reliability of the model. Let's consider this from a different angle: is this assurance of reliability necessarily tied to interpretability? If we can evaluate a model from multiple dimensions and conclude that it is reliable, do we really still need to be fixated on achieving interpretability? Furthermore, from another perspective, the interpretability we seek is essentially human interpretability. It is possible that the models already possess principles of machine interpretability, but we are unable to comprehend these principles. As a result, we perceive a lack of good interpretability.
